						<p>Incorrect! After seeing Bowie as a guest on Ayshea Brough's color TV show, Morrissey became aware of a world of culture, art, and identity outside of the one in which he grew up. He writes, <br>

							"As David Bowie appears, the child dies. The vision is profound- a sanity heralding the coming of consciousness of someone who- at last!- transcends our gloomy coal-fire existence. David Bowie is detached from everything, yet open to everything; stripped of the notion that both art and life are impossible. He is quite real, impossibly glamorous, fearless, and quite British. How could this possibly be?" p62</p>

				This site was designed and built by @ahoefinger, and the source code can be found on <!-- <a href=""> -->github<!-- </a> -->.
				When I first discovered Buzzfeed's quizzes, I became really interested in figuring out how they work and building one of my own. I thought a quiz about Morrissey would be fun, mainly because I learned a lot of trivia about his life and music from reading his <!-- <a href=""> -->autobiography<!-- </a> -->, and also because I saw that there is an abundance of hunky photos of Morrissey on the internet.
